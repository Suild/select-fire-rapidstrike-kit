Grants reliable select-fire control to your Rapidstrike with optional rate of fire control using a knob. Like every other kit, this one is super simple to install and requires no soldering directly onto the board to get everything up and runing in under a minute, even easier than a regular RS mod!

Built-in pusher return and solenoid support makes this kit easily adaptable to any custom 3D-printed blaster. A powerful voltage regulator buck converter, on-board Arduino Nano, and breakout of power rails make this ideal for tinkerers and Makers who want to bring this kit one step farther. And everything is open-source.

I hope you find value in this. I personally learned a lot from open-source projects. I've included a PDF for every schematic and images of the top and bottom for every board so you can view them on mobile and without installing Eagle CAD.
